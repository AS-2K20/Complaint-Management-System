# Complaint Management System

This project Complaint Management System is a Console based application which is developed using only backend technology. Using this application, an user can able to give complaints to the police without going to the police station. This application helps in giving more clarity and transparency among the user and the police.

## MVC Architecture:

I have followed the <a href="https://medium.com/edureka/mvc-architecture-in-java-a85952ae2684">Model View Controller(MVC)</a> Architecture of Java in this application.

## Note:

This is just a backend application which I have developed when I was learning the basics of Java. In the near future, I am planning to reconfigure or remodel this whole backend application into a Full Stack Application.
